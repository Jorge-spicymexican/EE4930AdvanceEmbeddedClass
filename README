This is the directions to run UnitTesting for TCI C Code
This demonstrates using Check along with one of two build systems:
CMake and LCOV.

===================================================================

CMake:

You need the following programs installed on your system:
  -- CMake 2.8
  -- Check 0.9.9
  -- (pkg-config 0.26 is optional)
  -- LCOV 1.0.0 or greater
  -- GCOV 

Somewhat earlier versions of these programs might work.

NOTE: If pkg-config is not installed on the system, and MSVC is being used,
the install location of Check must be inserted manually into the
tests/CMakeLists.txt file, by setting the variable CHECK_INSTALL_DIR
to the install location. Look at the tests/CMakeLists.txt file for
a commented out example.

Then, do as follows for a Unix-compatible shell:
make -f customMakeFile.mk clean
make -f customMakefile.mk BuildFolder
cd UnitTestBuild
make -f ../customMakeFile.mk RunUnitTest
make -f ../customMakeFile.mk RunLCOV

once you done simply run this command to erase of the generated files to rerun a new test
cd ../
make -f customMakeFile.mk clean


Don't do "make install" or "nmake install" unless you want to install the money example.

money.c and money.h are built as a library.  bsp/main.c:main() is a
client of libmoney.la, just as tests/check_money.c:main() is a client
of libmoney.la

To use the CMake example in another project, start with the following files:

   example
   |--- CMakeFiles.txt
   |--- cmake
   |    |--- config.h.in
   |    |--- FindCheck.cmake
   |--- src
   |    |--- CMakeFiles.txt
   |--- tests
        |--- CMakeFiles.txt
